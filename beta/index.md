**Hamburg** deserves a community security event and [we](about) are finally able to deliver. This September 16th, at the Side Hotel, the first Elbsides will take place. This one-day event will involve talks and workshops by top speakers at an affordable price. In the spirit of all BSides events we are aiming to keep admission at the price of a good meal, well under our costs. For this reason, we are dependent on [sponsors](sponsors) to make this happen.
