	<img src="images/dfn-cert.gif" alt="DFN CERT logo">
        <p>We are currently sponsored
          by <a href="https://www.dfn-cert.de">DFN-CERT</a> and <a href="https://www.bsidesmunich.org">BSidesMunich</a>, but we
          need more.</p>
	
        <p>As a community event, we strive to keep admission as
          low as possible but the fixed costs are high. We are
          dependent on sponsors to make this event happen. <b>More
            information will follow about sponsorshop
            opportunities in early 2019.</b>
